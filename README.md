# Conversational Chatbot for Multi-language clients

---

This project implements an AI chatbot using the Groq API. The chatbot takes user input and responds with short answers generated by a large language model. It is designed to handle conversational input in a loop, where the AI assistant gives concise responses based on user queries.

## Features

- Simple interaction with the AI model through the console.
- Ability to handle chat history to provide contextual responses.
- Uses Groq API for generating replies.
- Short and helpful assistant responses.
  
## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.8+**
- A **GROQ_API_KEY** from Groq (set in your environment variables).

### Setting up the API Key

1. Obtain your Groq API key.
2. Set the environment variable `GROQ_API_KEY` by adding it to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Alternatively, you can set it manually in your terminal before running the program:

   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daniya-safdar/Simple-AI-Chatbot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Simple-AI-Chatbot
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install groq
   ```

## Usage

Run the script to start the chatbot:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

The chatbot will wait for your input, and it will respond with short answers based on the AI modelâ€™s response. The conversation history is maintained during the session to provide context to the chatbot.

### Exiting the Chat

You can exit the chat by typing `exit` at any point.

## Example Interaction

```bash
You: Hello, how are you?
Assistant: Hello, I'm here to help. How can I assist you today?

You: Tell me about AI.
Assistant: AI refers to the development of machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

You: exit
Ending the chat. Goodbye!
```
